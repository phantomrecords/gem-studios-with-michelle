    The following link is a sample link, it is not operational but it has a landing page that simulates a calendar-scheculing page. This is to demonstrate the "user experience" of scheduling a voice session by clicking this link. Once on the resulting page, you can choose a day and a time, and Michelle will be notified. This is only a tst-link so no one will be notified, however, in the future, the developer making this page may activate the link to demonstrate it more fully.
